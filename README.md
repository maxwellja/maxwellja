ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @maxwellja
I am an aspiring data professional looking to leverage the strength and vigor of _analysis_ to better the planet.
I have experience with Python and many of its super duper libraries, and I'm getting more and more familiar with SQL and Bash every day.

In my free time I like to read, watch movies with my partner, run, backpack, and cook!

If you need help with your project, I would enjoy lending a hand!

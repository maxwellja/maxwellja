ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @maxwellja!

I am an aspiring data analytics professional. I have experience with SQL, Spreadsheets, Python, and data visualzation programs like Tableau. Here is display my personal projects to illustrate my skills. 

My SALMONQUEST project explores the historical salmon numbers going through the Columbia River basin each day to answer the following question: What is the best time of the year go out fishing to maximize the likelyhood of catching a salmon for dinner?

In my free time I like to read, cook, run, backpack around my home in Eugene, Oregon.

If you need help with your project, I would enjoy lending a hand!
